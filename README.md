# akaecliptic-beta

My second attempt at implementing akaecliptic.dev.

A lot less house cleaning was done, so excuse the atrocities, it was all part of the learning process.

I actually re-made https://akaecliptic.dev/ 2 times, with the 3rd being the current implementation. This is the second version.
The first can be found here - https://github.com/akaecliptic/akaecliptic-alpha
